#df -h
The -h option stands for "human-readable" and will display the sizes in a more easily readable format (e.g., in gigabytes, megabytes). The output will show information about each mounted file system along with the used and available disk space.

# du -h --max-depth=1 /
This command will display the disk usage of each directory under the root directory (/). Adjust the path as needed. The --max-depth=1 option ensures that it only shows the immediate subdirectories and their sizes.

Keep in mind that you might need administrative privileges (sudo) to access certain directories and get accurate disk usage information.
